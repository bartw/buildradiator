<h1>The Buildradiator</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The Buildradiator is a webapplication that gives you a handy overview of your builds (with a focus on the failed builds)</p>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>We strongly believe that a development team will be more productive and involved when everything surrounding the project is visible and transparant. This includes domainmodels, architecture, relations with external actors, organisation of the team, etc.</p>
<p>One of things that helps achieving this are digital infoscreens that are tailored to the project needs. However some of these parts can be generalized.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>Most teams that are using continuous integration servers (Jenkings, TeamCity, Travis CI,...) are interested in their builds, especially their failed builds. We try to give you an overview, by providing a webapplication that summarizes those builds. You can integrate this application in your infoscreen</p>
<h2>Practical</h2>
<p>For now, due to limited resources, we only support Teamcity. The project however is open source (MIT licence), so yourself can easily extend or modify it according to your needs.</p>
<p>The application is accessible through the following url: <a href="http://buildradiator.com/app/#stub" target="_blank">http://buildradiator/app/#{hostname}</a>(replace hostname by stub, to see fake data)</p>
<p>Don't forget to configure your buildserver to allow requests from buildradiator.com (<a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/REST+API#RESTAPI-CORSSupport" target="_blank">support teamcity</a>)</p>
<p>This is still work in progress. So be aware of the fact that breaking changes are possible</p>
<h2>Example integration using an iframe</h2>
