<h1>The Buildradiator</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The Buildradiator is a webapplication that must give you a handy overview of your builds (with a focus on the failed builds)</p>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>We strongly believe that a development team will be more productive and involved when everything surrounding the project is visible and transparant. This includes domainmodels, architecture, relations with external actors, organisation of the team, etc.</p>
<p>One of things that helps achieving this are digital infoscreens that are tailored to the project needs. However some of these parts can be generalized.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>Most teams that are using continuous integration servers (Jenkings, TeamCity, Travis CI,...) are interested in their builds, especially their failed builds. We try to give you an overview, by providing a webapplications that summarizes those builds. You can integrate this application in your infoscreen</p>
<h2>Practical</h2>
<p>For now, due to limited resources, we only support Teamcity. The project however is open source (MIT licence), so yourself can easily extend or modify it according to your needs.</p>
<p>The application is accessible through the following url: <a href="https://robisrob.github.io/buildradiator/app/#stub" target="_blank">https://robisrob.github.io/buildradiator/app/#{hostname}</a>(replace hostname by stub, to see fake data)</p>
<p>This is still work in progress. So be aware of the fact that breaking changes are possible</p>
